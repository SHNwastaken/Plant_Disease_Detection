This project implements a real-time plant disease detection system using computer vision. It leverages a two-stage approach:

1.  **Leaf Detection:** A YOLO (You Only Look Once) model (`leaf_detection_model.pt`) identifies the location of plant leaves within an input image or video stream.
2.  **Disease Classification:** A custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) (`plant_disease_model.pth`) analyzes the detected leaf regions to classify the specific plant disease (or determine if the leaf is healthy) from a set of 38 possible classes.

The system is designed to work with input from an ESP32-CAM module, providing a practical solution for monitoring plant health directly in the field or greenhouse. It offers both a command-line interface with OpenCV visualization (`integrated_detection.py`) and an interactive web-based GUI built with Streamlit (`final_gui.py`).

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Real-time Leaf Detection:** Utilizes a pre-trained YOLO model (`leaf_detection_model.pt`) for efficient localization of plant leaves.
*   **Multi-Class Disease Classification:** Employs a custom CNN (`plant_disease_model.pth`) trained to identify 38 different plant disease categories across various plant species (Apples, Corn, Grapes, Tomatoes, etc.).
*   **ESP32-CAM Integration:** Directly fetches image streams from an ESP32-CAM module over Wi-Fi for live analysis.
*   **Streamlit Web Interface (`final_gui.py`):** Provides an easy-to-use web GUI to:
    *   Start/Stop the live detection stream from the ESP32-CAM.
    *   Visualize the live feed with bounding boxes and disease predictions.
    *   View detection results stored in a CSV file.
    *   Adjust the leaf detection confidence threshold.
*   **OpenCV Interface (`integrated_detection.py`):** Offers a command-line alternative for running the integrated detection pipeline and visualizing results in a standard OpenCV window.
*   **Standalone Leaf Detection (`leaf_detection_v1.py`):** Script dedicated solely to testing and visualizing the YOLO leaf detection model.
*   **Standalone Disease Prediction (`disease_detection_v2.py`):** Contains the CNN model definition and basic functionality to predict disease from a single image file.
*   **Result Logging:** Saves detection events (timestamp, plant type, condition, confidence) to a CSV file (`results/detection_results.csv`) via the Streamlit interface.
*   **GPU Acceleration:** Supports CUDA acceleration via PyTorch and Ultralytics if a compatible NVIDIA GPU is available, significantly speeding up inference.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technology Stack

*   **Programming Language:** Python 3.8+
*   **Deep Learning Framework:** PyTorch
*   **Object Detection:** Ultralytics YOLO (using `leaf_detection_model.pt`)
*   **Web Framework (GUI):** Streamlit
*   **Computer Vision:** OpenCV (cv2)
*   **Image Handling:** PIL (Pillow)
*   **Numerical Computation:** NumPy
*   **Data Handling:** Pandas (for viewing results in Streamlit)

    *   ESP32-CAM module for live image input.

## üèõÔ∏è System Architecture

The core workflow involves these steps:

1.  **Image Acquisition:** An image frame is captured, either from a local file (in `disease_detection_v2.py`) or fetched from the ESP32-CAM URL (`final_gui.py`, `integrated_detection.py`, `leaf_detection_v1.py`).
2.  **Leaf Detection (YOLO):** The captured image is passed to the `leaf_detection_model.pt`. The model outputs bounding boxes coordinates and confidence scores for detected leaves.
3.  **Leaf Cropping:** For each detected leaf exceeding a confidence threshold, the corresponding region (bounding box) is cropped from the original image.
4.  **Disease Classification (CNN):** The cropped leaf image is preprocessed (resized, converted to tensor) and fed into the `plant_disease_model.pth`.
5.  **Prediction Output:** The CNN outputs probabilities for each of the 38 disease classes. The class with the highest probability is selected as the prediction.
6.  **Visualization & Logging:**
    *   Bounding boxes, detected leaf confidence, and predicted disease labels are drawn onto the original image.
    *   The annotated image is displayed either in the Streamlit interface or an OpenCV window.
    *   Detection results (timestamp, plant, condition, confidence) are optionally logged to a CSV file (in `final_gui.py`).


## üîß Setup and Installation

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Python 3.8 or higher
    *   `pip` (Python package installer)
    *   Git (for cloning the repository)
    *   **(Optional but Recommended)** NVIDIA GPU with CUDA and cuDNN drivers installed for significant performance improvement.

2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SHNwastaken/Plant_Disease_Detection.git
    cd Plant_Disease_Detection
    ```

3.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    *   Ensure the `requirements.txt` file provided in the repository is up-to-date. Based on the code, it should contain libraries like: `torch`, `torchvision`, `ultralytics`, `opencv-python-headless`, `streamlit`, `pandas`, `requests`, `Pillow`, `numpy`.
    *   Install the requirements:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        *(Note: Installing PyTorch might require specific commands depending on your OS and CUDA version. Refer to the [official PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for the correct command if you encounter issues.)*

5.  **Ensure Model Files are Present:**
    *   The `leaf_detection_model.pt` (YOLO) and `plant_disease_model.pth` (CNN) files should be in the root directory as shown in the structure. If you cloned the repository, they should already be there.

6.  **Configure ESP32-CAM URL:**
    *   Find the IP address of your ESP32-CAM module on your local network.
    *   Open the relevant Python files (`final_gui.py`, `integrated_detection.py`, `leaf_detection_v1.py`) and update the `esp32_cam_url` variable with your camera's capture URL (e.g., `http://<IP_ADDRESS>/capture`).
    *   **Example:** `esp32_cam_url = "http://192.168.1.100/capture"`

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Make sure your virtual environment is activated (`source venv/bin/activate` or `.\venv\Scripts\activate`) and you are in the project's root directory. Ensure the ESP32-CAM is powered on and connected to the same network if you intend to use it.

1.  **Run the Streamlit Web Interface (Recommended):**
    *   Provides the most user-friendly experience.
    ```bash
    streamlit run final_gui.py
    ```
    *   Open your web browser and navigate to the local URL provided by Streamlit (usually `http://localhost:8501`).
    *   Use the sidebar controls to enter the ESP32-CAM URL, adjust confidence, start/stop the stream, and view results.

2.  **Run the Integrated Detection with OpenCV:**
    *   Useful for testing or if a web interface is not needed. Displays results in a desktop window.
    ```bash
    python integrated_detection.py
    ```
    *   An OpenCV window will appear displaying the live feed with detections.
    *   Press `q` in the OpenCV window to quit.
    *   Detection details will be printed to the console.

3.  **Run Standalone Leaf Detection (YOLO Only):**
    *   For testing the `leaf_detection_model.pt` specifically.
    ```bash
    python leaf_detection_v1.py
    ```
    *   An OpenCV window will show the live feed with only leaf bounding boxes.
    *   Press `q` in the OpenCV window to quit.

4.  **Run Basic Disease Prediction on Static Images:**
    *   Uses the `disease_detection_v2.py` script for classifying *existing* image files.
    *   Modify the `test_images` list inside the script if needed.
    ```bash
    python disease_detection_v2.py
    ```
    *   Predictions for the specified images will be printed to the console.
